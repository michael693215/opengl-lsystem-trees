Simple OpenGL demo using GLFW and GLEW.

Rotate with the mouse or with the WASD keys.
'I' changes the light intensity, demonstrating passing data to shaders. 
'L' toggles between solid and line drawing, demonstrating changing state.
'R' reloads the shaders.

In general, there is one .hpp file per class, with the same name as the class.
Implementation functions for the class are either in the corresponding .cpp
file, or for inline functions in the corresponding .inl file.

Source code summary:

GLapp.hpp/GLapp.cpp: Overall application data, initialization code, and well
GLFW callbacks, and main rendering loop.

Shader.hpp/Shader.cpp: Loading and compiling shaders.

Object.hpp/Object.cpp: Base class for objects, managing vertex and index
arrays, textures, and shaders.

Plane.hpp/Plane.cpp: Minimal two-triangle object with hard-coded data.

Sphere.hpp/Sphere.cpp: Parametric sphere object with per-frame position
updates.

Config.hpp.in: Used by CMake to create build/Config.hpp to resolve data file paths.

Vec.hpp/Vec.inl: templated type, ops & functions for small fixed-sized vectors

Mat.hpp/Mat.inl: templated type, ops & functions for small fixed-sized square matrices
